# DATA-STARTERS_MICROSOFT_EXCEL_ON_DATA_CLEANING
This is my first personal project on data cleaning for excel with data starters community
This project demonstrates how to clean and analyze student grading data using **Microsoft Excel**.  
It includes data processing steps such as calculating totals, averages, and assigning grades using logical and arithmetic formulas.

## ðŸ§® Project Overview

The dataset contains students' scores in **Math, English, and Science**.  
Using Excel formulas and functions, we performed the following operations:

### ðŸ”¹ Cell References
- Used **mixed reference** to calculate total scores.
- Applied **absolute reference** to multiply totals by a bonus factor of `1.05`.

### ðŸ”¹ Arithmetic Formulas
- Computed the **average score** using:  
- Used the **coundictional formating** function to round averages to the nearest whole number.

### ðŸ”¹ Common Functions
- `COUNT()` â€“ counted the number of students who took the test.
- `COUNTA()` â€“ counted how many cells in the "Name" column were filled.

### ðŸ”¹ Logical Functions
- Assigned grades using the **IFS()** function:
Created a grade system:
- 70â€“100 â†’ Grade A  
- 60â€“69 â†’ Grade B  
- 50â€“59 â†’ Grade C  
- 40â€“49 â†’ Grade D  
- Below 40 â†’ Grade F
